It doesn&rsquo;t get any better than the highly anticipated, non-conference battle between the Michigan State Spartans and the Oregon Ducks. Fans were able to beat the heat and get ready for the game by listening to ESPN personality, Neil Everett, relive some of Oregon&rsquo;s greatest football moments with Duck greats Kenny Wheaton, who talked about &ldquo;The Pick,&rdquo; and Dennis Dixon, who waxed poetic on his memorable and exciting college career. After fans received autographs from Wheaton and Dixon, they were able to channel their inner Heisman and see if they had what it took to compete in the virtual &ldquo;Quarterback Challenge.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t matter if you finished first or third on the depth chart, everyone could act like a Heisman Trophy winner by getting their picture taken with the award and win a myriad of prizes, including the sought after foam Oregon helmets. The road to the first ever College Football Playoff is a long one, but the Nissan Heisman House will be there for every mile of the journey. Join the Tour on September 20, when all the action is brought to the fans live from Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>","site":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Nissan Heisman House will be located north of Autzen Stadium, on Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. and ESPN College GameDay Radio will be located south of the stadium, on Leo Harris Parkway.</span></p>","slug":"michigan-state-oregon","stopDate":"2014-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","stopNumber":1,"summary":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Nissan Heisman House Tour makes its first of ten stops this season in Eugene, and is inviting fans to \"get to know the Heisman Winners\" with a pregame experience unlike any other.

dual-threat quarterback put together one of the best senior seasons in school history. Dixon was arguably the top performer among all college signal callers in 2007 before a knee injury prematurely curtailed his Heisman Trophy campaign and ultimately ended the Ducks' BCS title game hopes.</p>\r\n<p>Dixon guided Oregon to an 8-1 record and a No. 2 seed in the BCS standings. The Pacific-10 Conference's unanimous Offensive Player of the Year and honorable mention All-American finished ninth on the school's single-season total offense chart (2,719 yards) despite playing in only 10 games</p>\r\n<p>Dixon completed his requirements for his major in sociology in less than four years, his accolades combining his academic (3.33 gpa) and athletic talents were unprecedented in the football program's history. Dixon finished fourth in the balloting for Associated Press Player-of-the-Year, he was one of three finalists for the Maxwell Award (College Player of the Year) and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award as well as one of five finalists for the Walter Camp Player-of-the-Year award</p>\r\n<p>His academic achievements were even more impressive as the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District quarterback was one of five student-athletes in school history (and Oregon's first football player ever) to be bestowed with the NCAA Top VIII Award. He also was the recipient of the National Football Foundation's Scholar-Athlete Award and accompanying post-graduate scholarship. He completed his collegiate career as the single-season and all-time school record-holder in passing completion percentage (67.7% and 63.9%, respectively). Dixon also established the school's standard for most career rushing yards (1,208) by an Oregon quarterback, while his 583 yards on the ground in 2007 finished second only to Reggie Ogburn's 644 yards from 1979 among the school's signal callers. He concluded his career sixth on Oregon's all-time list for total offense (6,339 yards) and eighth in passing yards (5,129).</p>\r\n<p>A major league baseball prospect in the Atlanta Braves organization, he was drafted in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>","createdAt":"2014-09-16T00:19:47.983Z","createdBy":"5409eaae49ab7902008b43a3","gender":"M","isActive":true,"isHeisman":false,"isTalent":false,"pageDescription":"Dennis Dixon's Nissan Heisman House profile","pageKeywords":"dennis dixon, dennis dixon oregon, nissan heisman house","pageTitle":"Dennis Dixon","slug":"dennis-dixon","title":"Former NFL Quarterback","updatedAt":"2014-09-16T00:26:01.020Z","updatedBy":"5409eaae49ab7902008b43a3","webpage":"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/11390/dennis-dixon","schools":["54078b99d7e9cea74be15120"],"name":{"last":"Dixon","first":"Dennis"}},{"__v":1,"_id":"541784b93c67ed0200c6bd55","bio":"<p>Kenny Wheaton and \"The Pick\" are now synonymous in terms of Oregon football lore.

At the time of his induction, he still held the school career record for most interception return yards (380) and shared the school mark for most interceptions returned for touchdowns (3). He left school a year early for the NFL Draft ranking eighth on the UO career interceptions list with 11.
